Image filter desktop application written in C# and WPF

Including:

**Smoothing filter**: This filter helps to reduce image noise and smoothen out any rough edges in the image.

**Median Filter**: This filter is useful for removing salt-and-pepper noise from an image by replacing each pixel value with the median value of the surrounding pixels.

**Edge Detection Filter (Sobel)**: This filter is used to detect edges in an image, which can be useful for image segmentation, feature extraction, and other image processing tasks.

**Dilatation**: This filter is used to expand the boundaries of objects in an image, making the objects appear larger and more prominent.

**Erosion**: This filter is used to shrink the boundaries of objects in an image, making the objects appear smaller and less prominent.
